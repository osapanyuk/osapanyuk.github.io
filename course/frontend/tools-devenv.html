Before we can jump into the course, we need to set up our environment. This is an important step. Just like with
building a house,
you don't just start hammering away; you need a blueprint, tools, and
a designated workspace. For front-end development, the **blueprint** is the code, and the **tools** are a code editor
like VS Code and a web browser. The **workspace** is your project directory, a folder on your computer where all your
related files—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—will live. VS Code acts as your primary workshop, a specialized text editor that
understands and highlights code, making it easier to write. The browser is where the analogy starts to break down a bit,
but in a way the browser takes your blueprint/code and displays it to the end user.

Some of the tools we will go over are outlined below. Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and you will most likely
incorporate new tools into your workflow as you continue on your journey.

1. VS Code: This is what is called a text editor, it has useful features like built-in terminal, syntax highlighting,
and interoperability with various useful extensions.
2. Browser Dev Tools: Useful for debugging live within the browser without having to constantly rebuild the project.
3. Work directory: A dedicated folder to stay organized for when you start working on multiple projects.
