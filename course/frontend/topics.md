    Chapter 00 - Tools & Dev Environment: This is a good starting point. Consider introducing DevTools here as the primary tool for inspecting and debugging, as students will use it throughout the course. This sets the stage for a more technical understanding from the get-go.

    Chapter 01 - Introduction & History: Perfect. Keep this light and conceptual.

    Chapter 02 - Hello World: Solid. This is the critical "first win" for students.

    Chapter 03 - Basic Elements: This chapter is a bit crowded. It's better to break up the content. You could have a separate chapter for images, links, and lists, as they are fundamental and have their own sets of attributes and best practices.

    Chapter 04 - Page Structure & Semantic HTML: This is a great topic. Emphasize the why more than the what to give students a deeper understanding of the importance of semantics.

    Chapter 05 - CSS Basics: This chapter is excellent but very foundational. Ensure you spend enough time on the box model. It's a key concept many beginners struggle with. A dedicated, hands-on session on margins, padding, and borders would be very beneficial.

    Chapter 06 - Layout & Positioning: This chapter is too ambitious. CSS layout is complex, especially for beginners. Split this into at least two chapters. You could have a chapter dedicated to Flexbox alone, as it's the modern standard for 1D layouts. Then, another chapter for traditional positioning and display types. Introducing CSS Grid here is too much, save that for a later, more advanced chapter.

    Chapter 07 - JavaScript Fundamentals: This is another chapter that's too packed. Separate JS fundamentals from DOM manipulation. A beginner's first exposure to JS should focus on variables, data types, and functions. The concept of the Document Object Model (DOM) is a big one and deserves its own chapter.

    Chapter 08 - Forms & User Input: This chapter is well-placed. Keep it focused on the basics.

    Chapter 09 - Intermediate JavaScript: This chapter is good, but again, consider the pacing. If you've split the fundamentals, this chapter can then focus on loops, conditionals, and arrays/objects, which are the building blocks of any program.

    Chapter 10 - Mini Project 1: This is a fantastic idea. Building a portfolio page is a very motivating project. The inclusion of GitHub Pages is a great way to introduce version control and hosting.

    Chapter 11 - CSS Advanced Styling: Good topics. This is the right place for CSS Grid and media queries.

    Chapter 12 - Working with External Resources: This is a great addition. You could also include a brief mention of APIs here, even if it's just a conceptual introduction to what they are and how a website might consume data from one.

    Chapter 13 - Mini Project 2: A To-Do List app is a perfect project for this level. It brings together all the concepts in a practical way.
